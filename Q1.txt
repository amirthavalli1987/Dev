HTTP 1.1
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.
Because it went through several stages of development,
this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
This version is still in use on the web.
It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it
 until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
 It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.


HTTP2
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.
HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in 
how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It uses HPACK for data compression.
